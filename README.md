# Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning
This is the 2025 Spirng course on deep learning and reinforcement learning at SUSTech.

## Basic Information
Course title: Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning

Hours/Credits: 32/2

Academic Dept.: School of System Design and Intelligent Manufacturing 

Scheduled: Spring Semester

Course type: Elective

Language of Instruction: Chineses and English

Prerequisites: There is no official pre-requisite of the course, although we expect students to have good background in linear algebra, optimization and probability. We will be primarily using Python. As such, I expect you to have elementary programming skills, e.g., writing a hello world program.

## Course description
This course presents fundamental theory and algorithms about deep learning and reinforcement learning. It is expected that the students can 
* master fundamental theory and algorithms about deep learning and reinforcement learning through lectures and literature reading
* grasp skills of deep learning and reinforcement learning with Python language through assignments and projects
* design and implement technical projects, and apply developed techniques to real-world applications (images, signals, robotics, etc.).

Course Assessment
* Form of examination: Class Performance + Mid-term project + Final project + Final exam
* Grading policy: Class performance 10%, Mid-term project 30%, Final project 30%, Final exam 30%.
